Optional is a container object used to contain not-null objects. 
Optional object is used to represent null with absent value. 
This class has various utility methods to facilitate code to handle values
 as ‘available’ or ‘not available’ instead of checking null values. 
 It is introduced in Java 8 and is similar to what Optional is in Guava.
